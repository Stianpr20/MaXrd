# Change log

## Version 0.8.0

- Merged the separate package-sections into one notebook, and made a *Core* directory for the core elements of the package. The folder *ExampleFiles* could in theory be deleted without affecting the package.
- `$XrayPath` created, which is a path to the main directory of the package. All other paths should be set relative to this.
- Removed `$XrayExamples`. Easy enough to use `$XrayPath`.
- Miscellaneous updates of the documentation.
- Updated `$PointGroups`: The association is now using non-formatted keys, some keys have been adjusted and more symbol variations have been added. Schoenflies symbols and class names information has also been added.
- Miscellanous updates to `$SpaceGroups`.
- The `XrayChangelog` function was updated. The log is now presented in a new window/notebook.
- Created `ExportCrystalData`.
- Renamed `AddCompoundToDataset` and `RemoveCompoundFromDataset` to `ImportCrystalData` and `DeleteCrystalData`, respectively.
- Updated the default data in `$CrystalData`.
- Addded the option "Threshold" to `StructureFactor`.
- Added the option "IgnoreSystematicAbsence" to `StructureFactor`.
- Updated `ReflectionList` to use Tuples. Table will be used if "HoldIndex" option is applied.
- `ScatteringFactor` and `StructureFactor` are now effectively Listable in regards to reflections.
- Added subgroup data to `$PointGroups`.
- Fixed a bug in `SymmetryEquivalentPositions` where the non-centring sub-routine was not working properly.
- Renamed `ScatteringFactor` to `AtomicScatteringFactor`.
- Deleted `$ScatteringFactors`; its functionality has been incorporated with `AtomicScatteringFactor`.
- Fixed a bug in `SymmetryEquivalentPositions` where too many equivalent positions were generated when not taking centring into account.
- Fixed a bug in `StructureFactor`; the multiplicity reduction was incorrect.
- Length- and energy quantities may now be input in `StructureFactor`.
- `$PhysicalConstants` discontinued.
- Created *CromerLiberman.m* from all the anomalous correction dat-files. This is now the default source for calculating corrections to the scattering factor in `AtomScatteringFactor`.
- Information on Wyckoff position and site symmetry has been implemented in `$SpaceGroups`.
- Added *InternationalTablesC(3rd)* as a source for coefficients used for calculating the atomic scattering factor.
- Expanded *WaasmaierKirfel.m* with ions.
- Added tabulated data for calculating atomic scattering factors from the *DABAX* directory found at <http://ftp.esrf.eu/scisoft/DabaxFiles/>.
- `AtomicScatteringFactor` now extracts elements from the atom data and not the chemical formula, and elements from the periodic table may be input directly.
- Auto-complete is now updated for `ImportCrystalData` and `DeleteCrystalData` after each successful execution.
- Added more unconventional space group settings for the monoclinic, tetragonal and trigonal crystal systems.
- Added scattering cross section data from *xraylib*, which is applied in `AttenuationCoefficient`.
- Added anomalous scattering factors (correction terms) from *xraylib*.
- Added the option *RationaliseThreshold -> 0.001* in `SymmetryEquivalentPositions`.
- Updated local variables in `StructureFactor` to coincide with notation used in coreCIF.
- `ImportCrystalData` can now store both *SiteSymmetryOrder* and *SiteSymmetryMultiplicity*.
- Better handling of chemical formulas in `ImportCrystalData`.
- Added sub routines to `InputCheck` for retrieving formula untis stored in `$CrystalData` and converting energy or wavelength input to angstroms.
- Separated the "development code" from the *Definitions.nb* notebook.
- Changed name of *ExtinctionDistance* to `ExtinctionLength`.
- Separated out the geometrical factor of the normal procedure for `ExtinctionLength` and `DarwinWidth` (the experimental angles can also be put in).
- Removed `AlignUB`, `ErrorPropagation`, `ExportReflectionFile`, `ImgScript`, `ImportReflectionFile`, `IntensityTable`, `MergeLogs`, `MonitorIni`, `LeastSquaresFit`, `PeakTableInspection`, `RefinedValues`, `RoundSignificants`, `UnwarpLayerList` and `WeightedMean` from the package (not considered core functions to X-ray or diffraction topics).
- `ExtinctionLength` and `DarwinWidth` are now practically listable in terms of reflections.
- All data sources used in `AtomicScatteringFactor` have been truncated at lambda = 2.5 angstroms.
- The space groups of the crystals *Copper* and *Aluminium* were changed from *Fd-3m* to *Fm-3m*.
- Corrected a couple of Hall strings (`C 4 -2a` and `F -4 -2`).
- *OldHallString* and *OldSymbolAlt* added for space groups 39, 41, 64, 67 and 68.
- Added label *GetCentringVectors* to `InputCheck`.
- Added option *UseCentring* to `SymmetryOperations`.
- The tag *SpaceGroupQ* in `InputCheck` has been replaced with a more thorough *InterpretSpaceGroup*, which will return the interpreted space group symbol and abort with messages if not successful.
- Created `CrystalFormulaUnits`. Some functionality was transferred from `CrystalDensity`.
- `SymmetryEquivalentPositions` is now practically listable in terms of coordinates.
- Crystal names can now be input to `GetElements` in order to return a list of elements in its *ChemicalFormula* or *AtomData*.
- Created `GetScatteringCrossSection`.
- Extended `InputCheck` with the label *InterpretElement*.
- Added "IgnoreIonCharge" option to `ImportCrystalData`.
- Several functions now have the name *Get-* prepended to them: `GetAtomicScatteringFactor`, `GetCrystalMetric`, `GetLatticeParameters`, `GetLaueClass`, `GetScatteringCrossSection`, `GetSymmetryData`, `GetSymmetryOperations`.
