@article{Ramsnes+2018,
	Abstract = {A comprehensive {\it Mathematica} package for crystallographic computations, {\it MaXrd}, has been developed. It comprises space-group representations based on {\it International Tables for Crystallography}, Vol. A, together with scattering factors from {\it XOP} and cross sections from {\it xraylib}. Featured functionalities include calculation of structure factors, linear absorption coefficients and crystallographic transformations. The crystal data used by {\it MaXrd} are normally generated from external {\tt .cif} files. The package comes with a dynamic documentation seamlessly integrated with the {\it Mathematica} system, including code, examples, details and options. From the onset, minimal {\it Mathematica} experience is required to make use of the package. It may be a helpful supplement in research and teaching where crystallography and X-ray diffraction are essential. Although {\it Mathematica} is a proprietary software, all the code of this package is open source. It may easily be extended to cover user-specific applications.},

	Abstract = {A specialised Mathematica package has been launched, which is intended to become a valuable tool in our line of work. Old and new code has been compiled to a single, organised and flexible package, featuring a neat documentation on usage.
 Theoretical foundations of X-ray diffraction and structural analysis has been examined in the thesis and connected with experimental data. A function has been written to make calculations of structure factors and quantities relevant to the dynamical theory of diffraction as accessible as possible. Comparison with the crystallographic literature has verified the output to be in accordance with the selected sources.
 The thesis has largely been devoted to an investigation of thiourea-ferrocene inclusion compounds subjected to cold temperatures. An initial analysis, involving only data at room temperature, was conducted in order to obtain accurate parameters of the diffractometer's instrument model, which was used in the following analyses.
 A systematic investigation of the reciprocal space of the thiourea-ferrocene crystals has been carried out, in addition to solving the structure of both ferrocene and thiourea-ferrocene.},

	Abstract = {New analytical X-ray scattering-factor representations valid for the full range of sin {$\Theta$}/{$\lambda$} from 0.0 to 6.0{\AA}${\sp {$-$}1}$ have been developed from fits of a linear combination of five Gaussians to the values of the scattering factors tabulated in {\it International Tables for Crystallography} (1992) [Vol. C. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers]. The resulting functions for both neutral atoms and ions are compared with the existing parametrizations, which are applicable for 0.0{--}2.0{\AA}${\sp {$-$}1}$ and 2.0{--}6.0{\AA}${\sp {$-$}1}$, respectively. The quality of the new parametrization involving 11 parameters per atom (ion) compares well with the previous work or is even superior. Examples are discussed, some errors in {\it International Tables for Crystallography}, Vol. C are indicated and a warning is given that most of the previously published four Gaussian expansions for ions are inadequate for calculations involving sin {$\Theta$}/{$\lambda$} {$\ge$} 2.0{\AA}${\sp {$-$}1}$.},

	Abstract = {The Monte Carlo simulation toolkit {\it ZMC} provides a general method for Monte Carlo simulation of disordered molecular displacements, orientations and site occupations. It is part of a suite of programs that allows convenient calculation of three-dimensional reciprocal space diffraction intensities. Such intensities are useful for extensive structure interpretations from diffraction experiments. Some physical properties can also be calculated from the simulation. This article reports the implementation of an integrated {\it ZMC} module that facilitates the construction of modulated molecular crystals and allows the corresponding calculation of modulation satellites. Use of the module is explained and examples illustrated. The method is ideally suited for novice treatment of modulated structure features and also as a basic platform to explore complex structure/properties relationships using atomistic simulation techniques.},

	Abstract = {The program {\it DISCUS} is a versatile tool for the analysis of diffuse scattering and for defect structure simulations. The model structure can be created from an asymmetric unit of a unit cell or a complete structure can be read from a file. A Fortran77 style interpreter that includes IF statements and various loops combined with predefined defect types like thermal displacements, waves and microdomains allows one to create all sorts of defect structures. The Fourier-transform segment of the program allows one to calculate neutron as well as X-ray intensities including isotropic temperature factors and anomalous scattering. The calculation of the inverse and difference Fourier transform as well as the Patterson function is also implemented. A model structure can be `fitted' to observed diffuse scattering data by reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulations. The RMC segment allows one to model displacive as well as occupational disorder. The program is completely written in Fortran77 and the source code is available via the World Wide Web.},

	Abstract = {The advent of structural genomics initiatives has led to a pressing need for high-throughput macromolecular structure determination. To accomplish this, new methods and inevitably new software must be developed to accelerate the process of structure solution. To minimize duplication of effort and to generate maintainable code efficiently, a toolbox of basic crystallographic software components is required. The development of the {\it Computational Crystallography Toolbox} ({\it cctbx}) has been undertaken for this purpose. In this paper, the fundamental requirements for the {\it cctbx} are outlined and the decisions that have lead to its implementation are explained. The {\it cctbx} currently contains algorithms for the handling of unit cells, space groups and atomic scatterers, and is released under an Open Source license to allow unrestricted use and continued development. It will be developed further to become a comprehensive library of crystallographic tools useful to the entire community of software developers.},
